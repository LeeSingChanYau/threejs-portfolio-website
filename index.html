        <h2>📜 About me</h2>
        <p>
          I majored in Computer Science from UC Santa Cruz in 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a Software Engineer that specializes in Web and Mobile development, and with interest in Machine Learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was born in Chile and I moved to Hong Kong when I was 12, and I went to college later on in California. Because of
          my circumstances, I had the opportunity to learn Spanish, English, and Chinese during my childhood and teenage years.
          My curiosity in technology began early on when I was still a kid, as early as I began playing video games. Tech is a 
          big part of who I am because I see many problems that can be solved using software.

          Covid-19 Tracker. Developed a web app using React.js disease.sh api that tracks the statistics of COVID-19 cases
          throughout the world. Used Material-UI to create the map and list of countries. Showcases with a circular radius where there
          are more infected people.

          Restaurant food ordering app. Developed a web-app for a restaurant using React.js that displays the menu and
          contact information. Costumers are able to click on a button that enables them to order food via whatsapp. Customers are
          able to order food directly from the web app, similar to Ubereats, leading to more orders for the restaurant.
